# Resistance-Operation-Overhaul
A modified version of Favid's mod that adds/changes the following:

- Made eInvSlot_Pistol a Unique Item slot that only appears when Dedicated Pistol Slot is installed.
- Secondary and Sidearm Slot weapons now accept attachments.
- Added a configuration option to allow unlimited perks per rank, instead of just one.
- Soldier rank ups are now configurable in when they happen, instead of them being after every mission (By default they rank up after every mission.)
- Added Utility slots 4 and 5 for those running increased Utility slots.
- Starting Mission/Missions are now configurable (So you don't get Swarm Defence with 4 Squaddies.)
- GenerateUnit Now considers the Character pool's Character Template before creating the soldier, instead of defaulting to Soldier.
